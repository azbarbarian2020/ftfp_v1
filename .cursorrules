# Cursor Rules for FTFP Snowflake SPCS Projects

## Project Context
This is a Fleet Telemetry Failure Prediction (FTFP) application using:
- Snowflake Snowpark Container Services (SPCS)
- FastAPI backend with Python
- React frontend (pre-built)
- XGBoost ML models for failure prediction
- Deployment via GitHub repository

## Critical Rules - NEVER Violate

### Docker Images
- ALWAYS use `--platform linux/amd64` when building Docker images
- Image path format: `account.registry.snowflakecomputing.com/database/schema/repo/image:tag`
- Database, schema, repo MUST be lowercase in image paths
- Login to registry host only, not full path: `docker login account.registry.snowflakecomputing.com`

### Database Operations
- DATABASE CLONE does NOT clone: UDFs, stages, image repos, services, compute pools
- After cloning, MUST manually recreate: stages, copy models, create UDFs
- RESULT_SCAN must IMMEDIATELY follow SHOW command (no statements between)
- Seed tables (NORMAL_SEED, *_FAILURE_SEED) are operational data, NOT legacy - DO NOT DELETE

### Source of Truth
- ALWAYS extract code from working Docker image, NEVER from disk files
- Verify frontend with MD5 hash - must match working version exactly
- When changing database refs, replace ALL occurrences and verify with grep

### Snowflake CLI
- Use `snow sql --connection NAME -q "SQL"` for queries
- Use `snow stage copy` for file uploads
- Use `snow spcs image-registry login` for Docker auth

### SPCS Services
- Use CPU_X64_XS instance family (smallest, often fastest for this workload)
- Service logs: `CALL SYSTEM$GET_SERVICE_LOGS('SERVICE', '0', 'container', 100)`
- Endpoint URL from: `SHOW ENDPOINTS IN SERVICE SERVICE_NAME`

### ML Models
- 6 PKL files required in @ML.MODELS stage
- Python UDFs load models via IMPORTS clause
- First UDF call takes ~5 seconds (model loading), subsequent calls fast

### What Doesn't Work
- Native App image bundling (no working syntax)
- COPY INTO from GitHub URLs
- External stages with HTTPS URLs
- Python UDFs with external packages in Native App versioned schemas

## File Locations
- SQL scripts: `snowflake/`
- Seed data + models: `seed_data/` (upload to Snowflake stages)
- Backend: `backend/main.py`
- Frontend: `frontend/build/` (pre-built React)
- Docker: `docker/Dockerfile`

## Deployment Flow
1. Run `01_INFRASTRUCTURE.sql` (creates DB, stages, compute pool)
2. Upload CSV files to @FTFP_V1.FTFP.SEED_STAGE via Snowsight UI
3. Upload PKL files to @FTFP_V1.ML.MODELS via Snowsight UI
4. Run `02_LOAD_DATA_AND_DEPLOY.sql` (loads data, creates UDFs)
5. Docker pull/tag/push from GHCR to Snowflake
6. CALL DEPLOY_SERVICE()

## Common Errors & Fixes
- "invalid identifier repository_url" → RESULT_SCAN not immediately after SHOW
- "Unsupported feature Copy into from Git Repository" → Use internal stage instead
- "image does not exist" → Check lowercase in image path
- Predictions not updating → Wrong frontend build, extract from working image
- Service writes to wrong DB → Hardcoded refs in backend, change ALL occurrences
